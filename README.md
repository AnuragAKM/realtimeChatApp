## üíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running or a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas account.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Backend:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    - Add your environment variables:
      ```env
      PORT=5000
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key
      ```

2.  **Frontend:**
    - The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:5000` by default. If you change the backend port, update the `src/config.js` or similar file.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running! Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see it in action.
